# libssp: Library for speech signal processing

`libssp` is simply a translation of some of the python library SSP into C++.
SSP can be found at https://github.com/idiap/ssp
This in turn allows it to  be linked into projects that are themselves in C++.

Currently, the python library has more functionality.

`libssp` depends upon `libube` (https://github.com/pgarner/libube) for
configuration and for broadcasting operations across arrays.
